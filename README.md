# ft_printf
Project ft_printf of Hive Helsinki

In this project we were supposed to re-write the lib-c function printf with some minimum-requirements and as many additional features as we liked. I went with the basics, but might be I will re-submit the project with some extras in the near future.

Must handle:

- modifiers: csp
- modifiers diouxX
  - with flags h, hh, l & ll
- modifier f
  - with flags l & L
- Flags: #+-0 & ' '
- Min field width
- Precision
